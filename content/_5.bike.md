# Smallest bike, largest pedestrian

In past discussions about Artificial Intelligence, two ideas have reigned supreme. First, the notion that real, general AI is merely science fiction, and second, the belief that AI only exists as a tool, never meant to replace human work.

However, the second argument is becoming increasingly questionable, especially when it comes to the idea of replacement. Current AIs have already proven themselves more successful than humans in completing law and medicine exams, adept enough to replace BuzzFeed journalists as content creators, and capable of producing art so realistic it can make you do a double take. As we stand on the precipice of a new technological revolution, it is time to reconsider what defines us as human and contemplate how we can coexist with entities more intelligent than ourselves. If the thinking ape no longer needs to think, what lies ahead?

After the initial laughable attempts to define humanity (remember the featherless biped?), we eventually settled on our cognitive abilities as the differentiating factor between us and other animal species. With our large and intricate brains, we colonized the entire planet, constructed complex social structures, and developed tools to aid us in our daily lives. To assert our dominance over all other life forms, we exploited and irrevocably altered our environment, pushing our society to irrational extremes. Amidst a political and economic landscape that offers little reason for hope, a new wave of innovation presents us with an opportunity to reassess our choices and redefine the *raison d’être* of mankind.

During an interview with a designer experienced in AI, a metaphor stuck with me. In the Netherlands, sidewalks often have barriers to prevent motorbikes and cyclists from passing through, but these barriers are also wide enough to accommodate wheelchair or walker users. The issue arises when a large pedestrian with a walker occupies the same width as a smaller-than-average cyclist. When designing for accessibility, the pedestrian's needs must be considered, but if the barriers are set too far apart, their original purpose is lost. This metaphor reflects the existential crisis facing humanity. In this analogy, we humans are the slower, bulkier pedestrians, while AI represents the sleek, nimble cyclists effortlessly maneuvering through the barriers. If we solely define consciousness based on tests of self-awareness, reasoning skills, or creative ideation, some humans will not measure up, while some AIs will pass with flying colors. Artificial Intelligence may inadvertently bring about a new form of ableism, where job interviews ask if you are smarter than the AI, and if not, you are replaced by software.

With AI poised to take away jobs from both creative and technical professionals, we can only imagine what a post-capitalism world might entail. Once the need for software developers, secretaries, or lawyers diminishes, what occupations will remain? Will we accept watching AI-generated movies, listening to AI-composed music, or seeking advice from an AI doctor? What if future economic crises are the result of bugs in financial AIs rather than human greed? While being governed by silicon-based overlords remains confined to the realm of fiction, our increasing reliance on AI for day-to-day decision-making brings us ever closer to a dystopian reality.
